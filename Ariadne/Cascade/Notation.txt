* For a QCDDipole:

  iPart() gives the parton carrying the colour charge (quark or gluon)
  oPart() gives the parton with the anti-colour charge (anti-quark or gluon)

  In the dipole cms
  iPart() is parton 1 and has LARGE POSITIVE rapidity
  oPart() is parton 3 and has LARGE NEGATIVE rapidity

  this->next()->iPart() == this->oPart()
  this->prev()->oPart() == this->iPart()
